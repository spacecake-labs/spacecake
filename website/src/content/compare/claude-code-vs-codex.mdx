## Claude Code Overview

Claude Code is Anthropic's agentic coding tool. It runs on the [Claude model family](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview) (including Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, and Haiku 4.5) and supports context windows [up to 1M tokens](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) (Opus 4.6 beta). Key capabilities:

- **deep codebase understanding**: analyzes entire repositories for context-aware edits
- **multi-file refactoring**: coordinated changes across many files in a single session
- **agentic execution**: runs commands, tests, and iterates on solutions autonomously
- **agent teams**: orchestrates multiple Claude Code sessions working on a shared project (experimental)
- **IDE extensions**: native plugins for [VS Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/vs-code) and JetBrains alongside the CLI

### Best For

- complex refactoring across large codebases
- understanding unfamiliar projects
- tasks requiring careful architectural reasoning
- developers who want IDE integration alongside a CLI

<ProsCons
  product="Claude Code"
  pros={[
    "Largest context window available (up to 1M tokens)",
    "Superior reasoning on complex, multi-step problems",
    "Native VS Code and JetBrains extensions",
    "Open source CLI",
    "Strong multi-file editing with codebase awareness",
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Requires API key setup",
    "1M context requires tier 4 API access",
    "Higher per-token cost than Codex at equivalent tiers",
  ]}
/>

## Codex Overview

OpenAI Codex is a full agentic coding platform with a [CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/) and web app. The CLI is [open source](https://github.com/openai/codex), built in Rust, and runs locally. It uses GPT-5.x-Codex models, the latest being GPT-5.3-Codex (February 2026). Key capabilities:

- **agentic CLI**: reads, edits, and runs code in your local repository
- **cloud tasks**: the Codex web app runs tasks in sandboxed cloud environments
- **multi-agent support**: integrates with the OpenAI Agents SDK for parallel workstreams
- **agent skills**: reusable, shareable task-specific workflows
- **code review agent**: a separate agent reviews changes before commit

### Best For

- teams already using OpenAI products
- developers who want both local CLI and cloud-based task execution
- workflows that benefit from OpenAI's subscription pricing model
- projects using the OpenAI Agents SDK

<ProsCons
  product="Codex"
  pros={[
    "Competitive API pricing ($1.25/$10 per 1M tokens for GPT-5.1-Codex)",
    "Open source CLI built in Rust",
    "Cloud and local execution modes",
    "Strong OpenAI ecosystem integration",
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Smaller context window than Claude Code",
    "No native IDE extensions (CLI and web only)",
    "Reasoning depth trails Claude on complex tasks",
  ]}

## Claude Code vs Codex: Feature Comparison

### Code Quality

Claude Code's reasoning capabilities give it an edge on complex tasks. With Opus 4.6's adaptive thinking, it decides when deeper reasoning is needed and produces code that:

- handles edge cases proactively
- follows established patterns in your codebase
- provides thorough error handling
- makes coherent changes across multiple files

Codex generates functional code quickly and GPT-5.3-Codex represents a significant step up in coding performance. For straightforward tasks, the two are closely matched. The gap widens on multi-step refactoring and architectural work.

### Context Understanding

Claude Code's context window tops out at [1M tokens with Opus 4.6](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) (200K standard). This lets it hold entire modules or even small-to-medium repositories in context, leading to more coherent cross-file changes.

Codex's GPT-5.2-Codex supports [up to 400K tokens](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.2-codex). This is substantial, but Claude Code holds a clear advantage for large codebases. Both tools use context compaction strategies to manage long sessions.

### Developer Experience

**Claude Code** provides:

- CLI with real-time cost and token tracking
- native VS Code extension with inline diff review
- JetBrains plugin for IntelliJ, WebStorm, and PyCharm
- conversation history and project-aware context
- agent teams for parallel task orchestration

**Codex** provides:

- CLI with configurable autonomy levels (suggest, auto-edit, full-auto)
- web app for sandboxed cloud execution
- built-in code review agent
- agent skills for repeatable workflows
- MCP support for third-party tool integration

Both tools support MCP for extensibility and offer multi-agent workflows for larger tasks.

## Pricing Comparison

Both tools offer usage-based API pricing. Codex is also accessible through ChatGPT subscriptions.

| Model             | Input           | Output        |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Claude Haiku 4.5  | $1/1M tokens    | $5/1M tokens  |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $3/1M tokens    | $15/1M tokens |
| Claude Opus 4.5   | $5/1M tokens    | $25/1M tokens |
| GPT-5.1-Codex     | $1.25/1M tokens | $10/1M tokens |
| GPT-5.2-Codex     | $1.75/1M tokens | $14/1M tokens |

_GPT-5.3-Codex API pricing not yet announced as of February 2026. Codex is also available via [ChatGPT subscriptions](https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing/) starting at $20/month (Plus) with usage limits. For the latest figures, see [Claude pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing) and [OpenAI API pricing](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing)._

Codex has a lower per-token entry point with GPT-5.1-Codex at $1.25/$10. Claude Code's Haiku tier is competitive at $1/$5, but the most capable Claude models (Sonnet, Opus) cost more per token. For subscription-based access, Codex's ChatGPT Plus tier at $20/month is an affordable entry point.

## When to Choose Each

### Choose Claude Code If:

- you need deep reasoning about code architecture
- your projects span many files and require large context
- you want native IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains)
- you need the largest available context window (up to 1M tokens)
- detailed code explanations matter to your workflow

### Choose Codex If:

- you're building on the OpenAI ecosystem
- you want both local CLI and cloud-based task execution
- lower per-token API pricing is a priority
- your team uses the OpenAI Agents SDK
- you prefer subscription-based pricing via ChatGPT

## Verdict

For most developers, **Claude Code is the stronger choice** in 2026. Its larger context window, deeper reasoning on complex tasks, and native IDE extensions make it the more capable tool for serious coding work — particularly multi-file refactoring and architectural tasks.

Codex has closed the gap significantly. Its open source Rust CLI is fast, GPT-5.3-Codex delivers strong coding performance, and the pricing is competitive. It's a solid choice for teams already in the OpenAI ecosystem or those who value cloud-based task execution.

Both tools now support agentic workflows, MCP, and multi-agent orchestration. The best approach is to try both on a real project. The right choice depends on your workflow, team, and which model's reasoning style clicks for you.
