## "permission denied" on macos

go to System Settings → Privacy & Security and allow `spacecake` to run.

## something looks wrong

press `⌘R` to refresh the app. if the issue persists in rich mode, switch to source mode to see the underlying markdown.

## terminal doesn't match the app theme

after toggling between light and dark themes, the terminal may not update immediately. press `⌘R` / `ctrl+R` to reload the app, or quit and reopen. this is a known issue we're working on.

## debugging issues

open Chrome DevTools from within `spacecake` to view console logs.

## slow file watching on linux or windows

spacecake uses @parcel/watcher for detecting file changes. on linux and windows, installing [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) significantly improves file watching performance and reliability for large projects. spacecake will show a tip in the status bar recommending this. see the [watchman installation guide](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install) for setup instructions.

## claude code: IDE disconnected

- verify `~/.claude/settings.json` has the correct `statusLine` configuration (see [claude code integration](/claude-code-integration#status-line))
- restart Claude Code after making changes
