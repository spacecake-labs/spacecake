`spacecake` is a desktop markdown editor designed for working with AI coding agents. it gives [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) context about your open files, displays live session metrics, and lets you visually edit the plans and specs that Claude creates.

## installation

`spacecake` is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

<div class="sl-flex" style="gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <GitHubDownloadButton platform="macos-arm64" />
  <GitHubDownloadButton platform="macos-x64" />
</div>

<PlatformDownloads />

you can also build from source by following the steps in the [release pipeline](https://github.com/spacecake-labs/spacecake/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml).

### step 1: download

- **macOS**: download the `.dmg` file (arm64 for Apple Silicon, x64 for Intel) or `.zip` for manual installation
- **Windows**: download the `.exe` installer
- **Linux**: download the `.deb` file (for Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu) or `.AppImage` for other distros

### step 2: install

**for DMG (macOS):**

1. open the downloaded `.dmg` file
2. drag the `spacecake` app into your Applications folder
3. launch `spacecake` from Applications or Spotlight (cmd+Space)

**for ZIP (macOS):**

1. extract the `.zip` file
2. move the extracted `spacecake.app` to your Applications folder
3. launch `spacecake` from Applications or Spotlight (cmd+Space)

**for EXE (Windows):**

1. run the downloaded `.exe` installer
2. follow the installation prompts (you may see a Windows SmartScreen warning since the installer isn't code-signed yet - click "More info" then "Run anyway" to proceed)
3. launch `spacecake` from the Start menu or desktop shortcut

**for DEB (Linux):**

1. install the package: `sudo dpkg -i spacecake_*.deb`
2. launch `spacecake` from your application menu or run `spacecake` in your terminal

### step 3: open your first project

when `spacecake` launches, you'll start in your home folder (`~/.spacecake`). press `⌘O` (or `ctrl+O` on Windows/Linux) to open your project's root directory.

you can create notes and folders in your home folder, or open any project folder as a workspace anytime.

## next steps

- learn about [workspaces, tabs, and keyboard shortcuts](/editor-basics)
- explore [markdown features](/writing-markdown) like code blocks, checklists, and mermaid diagrams
- set up the [claude code integration](/claude-code-integration) for AI-assisted editing
