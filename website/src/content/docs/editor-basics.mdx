## workspaces

a workspace is a folder you're working in. switch workspaces with `⌘O` / `ctrl+O` or by clicking the sidebar header.

your home folder (`~/.spacecake`) is always available for notes that aren't tied to a specific project.

## files and tabs

- **quick open**: press `⌘P` / `ctrl+P` to search and open files by name
- **new file**: press `⌘N` / `ctrl+N` to create a new file
- **close tab**: press `⌘W` / `ctrl+W` or click the × on the tab
- **save**: press `⌘S` / `ctrl+S` to save the current file

tabs show open files at the top of the editor. scroll horizontally if you have many tabs open.

## autosave

spacecake can automatically save files as you edit. enable autosave in workspace settings:

1. click the gear icon in the sidebar (or navigate to Settings)
2. toggle **enable autosave** on

when enabled, changes are saved to disk automatically - no need to press `⌘S` / `ctrl+S`.

## terminal

the integrated terminal is at the bottom of the screen. toggle it with `` ctrl+` ``, or click and drag the top edge to resize.

each workspace gets its own terminal session, started in the workspace's root directory using your default shell. switching to a different workspace ends the current session and starts a fresh one in the new workspace.

collapsing the terminal keeps the session alive — your shell state, environment variables, and running processes are all preserved when you expand it again. clicking the delete button in the terminal header kills the session entirely; the next time you open the terminal, it starts a new shell.

`EDITOR` and `VISUAL` are set to `spacecake open --wait`, so tools like `git commit` and `crontab -e` open files directly in the editor.
