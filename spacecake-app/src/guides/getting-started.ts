spacecake is a WYSIWYG markdown editor with an integrated terminal, built for Claude Code and other CLI agents.

## quick start

- **open a project**: press \`⌘O\` to open your project's root directory (works like VS Code or Cursor)
- **create a new file**: press \`⌘N\` (or \`Ctrl+N\` on linux)
- **quick open**: press \`⌘P\` to search and open files

## your home folder

this is your spacecake home folder (\`~/.spacecake\`). you can:

- create notes and folders here
- organize your files however you like
- open any project folder as a workspace anytime

the \`.app\` folder contains spacecake system files - feel free to ignore it.

## tips

- press \`⌘S\` to save your changes to disk
- use markdown formatting for headings, lists, code blocks, and more
- toggle between rich and source view with the view switching button

happy writing!
